It's in English, but I'm a Brazilian software developer  

I'm currently studying and researching game coding, optimized, lightweight and extremely compatible. 
  
I'm developing a game engine with the focus on weaker computers, it's currently in the initial construction process, but the goal I want to reach is very far, it doesn't matter if it's being built with limitations.

the engine is currently being developed for 2 operating systems, such as Windows and LINUX, in the future I will extend this to BSD, Android and some Unix-based systems.  
the engine supports ``i686`` processors for now, but in the future I will implement it for ``ARM`` , ``AMD64`` too  .



I really like the C language, specifically the ANSI C 89 standard, it is well supported by several compilers and very easy to read and identify, what about C++? I don't like .
